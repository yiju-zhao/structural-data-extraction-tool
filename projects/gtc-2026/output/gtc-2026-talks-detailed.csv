S81564,AI-First Design: Build Smarter From Day Zero Through Every Funding Stage [S81564],Talks or Panels,https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/sessions/gtc26-s81564/,"Amit Bleiweiss (Sr. Data Scientist, NVIDIA); Daman Oberoi (NVIDIA)","The decisions AI-first companies make on Day Zero will radically shift based on initial resources. Does a $5 million seed round change the fundamental AI strategy compared to a bootstrapped $0 start? Absolutely. This session explores four distinct Day Zero scenarios, each representing a different starting capital: $0 (Bootstrapped), $500,000 (Pre-Seed), $5 million (Seed/Series A), and $50 million (Series B+). For each scenario, we'll highlight high-leverage AI-first tactics, illustrating how capital immediately dictates where to spend resources and how fast to build proprietary technology.

S81811,"All the Precision, None of the Transistors [S81811]",Talks or Panels,https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/sessions/gtc26-s81811/,"Harun Bayraktar (Sr. Director of Software Engineering, Libraries, NVIDIA)","We challenge the notion that modern AI-era GPUs are unsuitable for high-precision computations, specifically double-precision (FP64), the cornerstone of scientific computing since 1985. While scalar and vector FP64 throughput in GPUs have continued to improve over generations, Tensor Core throughput for FP64 has not grown at the same rate as reduced-precision operations used by AI. This is alleviated with mixed-precision linear algebra algorithms and Ozaki schemes that utilize reduced-precision Tensor Cores delivering significant performance and efficiency gains while guaranteeing native FP64 accuracy. We will showcase recent advancements in these algorithms, how to use them, and demonstrate their effectiveness in real-world applications. We will also preview an experimental analysis tool designed to improve developer productivity in reasoning about precision choices.",All Industries,"CUDA, Blackwell"
