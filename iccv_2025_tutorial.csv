Unlike recent breakthroughs in reasoning-focused LLMs, many VLMs still rely primarily on pattern recognition and struggle with compositional logic. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of reasoning capabilities in VLMs, focusing on the transition from basic perception to complex inference. We will explore reasoning-oriented prompting and training techniques in multimodal contexts, reasoning-focused benchmarks, and architectural innovations for visual-textual fusion. Through lectures and hands-on demonstrations, participants will gain insights into current capabilities, persistent challenges in compositional generalization and explainability, and practical guidance for implementing reasoning mechanisms. This tutorial uniquely bridges advances in LLM reasoning with the visual domain, addressing the distinct challenges of spatial information processing and providing a roadmap toward more cognitively capable vision-language systems."

Learning Deep Low-Dimensional Models from High-Dimensional Data: From Theory to Practice,Qing Qu · Zhihui Zhu · Sam Buchanan · Liyue Shen · Peihao Wang · Yi Ma,,"Over the past decade, the advent of deep learning and large-scale computing has immeasurably changed the ways we process, interpret, and predict with data in imaging and computer vision. The ``traditional'' approach to algorithm design, based around parametric models for specific structures of signals and measurements---say sparse and low-rank models---and the associated optimization toolkit, is now significantly enriched with data-driven learning-based techniques, where large-scale networks are pre-trained and then adapted to a variety of specific tasks. Nevertheless, the successes of both modern data-driven and classic model-based paradigms rely crucially on correctly identifying the low-dimensional structures present in real-world data, to the extent that we see the roles of learning and compression of data processing algorithms---whether explicit or implicit, as with deep networks---as inextricably linked. As such, this tutorial provides a timely tutorial that uniquely bridges low-dimensional models with deep learning in imaging and vision. This tutorial will show how (i) these low-dimensional models and principles provide a valuable lens for formulating problems and understanding the behavior of modern deep models in imaging and computer vision, and (ii) how ideas from low-dimensional models can provide valuable guidance for designing new parameter efficient, robust, and interpretable deep learning models for computer vision …"

Benchmarking Egocentric Visual-Inertial SLAM at City Scale,Shaohui Liu · Anusha Krishnan · Jakob Engel · Marc Pollefeys,,"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental technique with applications spanning robotics, spatial AI, and autonomous navigation. It addresses two tightly coupled challenges: localizing the device while incrementally building a coherent map of the surroundings. Localization, or positioning, involves estimating a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DoF) pose for each image in a continuous sequence, typically aided by other sensor data, while mapping involves constructing an evolving representation of the surrounding environment. This tutorial specifically addresses the task of accurate positioning for large-scale egocentric data using visual-inertial SLAM and odometry (VIO). It offers a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by VIO/SLAM methods on egocentric data and introduces a new dataset and benchmark that can serve as a robust testbed for benchmarking these systems. With the help of well-positioned speakers, this tutorial explores the new benchmarking approach by analyzing failure cases, identifying limitations, and highlighting open problems in open-source academic VIO/SLAM systems. Additionally, it provides hands-on experience using the dataset and evaluation tools for researchers to get started with their own SLAM evaluations."
Foundation Models for 3D Asset Synthesis.,Yangguang Li · Angela Dai · Minghao Chen · Zhaoxi Chen,,"In recent years, thanks to the continuous innovation and progress of diffusion technology, significant advancements have been made in image and video generation. By inputting textual descriptions or images, we can generate high-quality images or videos, which greatly enhance creative efficiency and imagination. However, progress in the 3D generation field has been relatively slow. Initially, optimization routes, represented by DreamFusion, were explored. This was followed by the exploration of reconstruction routes, such as LRM. It was only later that diffusion based on 3D generation techniques, similar to those in image and video generation, were gradually developed.In addition, based on the token-by-token prediction form similar to LLM, 3D generation based on autoregressive method has gradually made significant progress. Therefore, this tutorial focuses on the topic of 3D asset generation using diffusion and autoregression, specifically including: (1) Geometry generation modeling based on the diffusion paradigm; (2) Geometry generation modeling based on the autoregression paradigm; (3) Texture generation modeling based on the diffusion paradigm."

Recent attempts at interpreting the decisions made by a deep network can be broadly classified in two categories, (i) methods that seek to explain existing models (post-hoc explainability), and (ii) methods that seek to build models that are explainable by design. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of both approaches along with a discussion on their limitations. More specifically, this tutorial will consist of three lectures covering the following topics:
Post-hoc explainability methods; Explaining deep networks using Shapley values and statistical testing; Explainable-by-design deep networks."

Towards Safe Multi-Modal Learning: Unique Challenges and Future Directions,Xi Li · Muchao Ye · Manling Li,,"Modern multi-modal learning leverages large models, such as large language models (LLMs), to integrate diverse data sources (e.g., text, images, audio, and video) and enhance understanding and decision-making. However, the inherent complexities of multi-modal learning introduce unique safety challenges that existing frameworks, primarily designed for uni-modal models, fail to address. This tutorial explores the emerging safety risks in multi-modal learning and provides insights into future research directions. We begin by examining the unique characteristics of multi-modal learning -- modality integration, alignment, and fusion. We then review existing safety studies across adversarial attacks, data poisoning, jailbreak exploits, and hallucinations. Next, we analyze emerging safety threats exploiting multi-modal challenges, including risks from additional modalities, modality misalignment, and fused representations. Finally, we discuss potential directions for enhancing the safety of multi-modal learning. As multi-modal learning expands, addressing its safety risks is crucial. This tutorial lays the foundation for understanding these challenges and fostering discussions on trustworthy systems."
Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents,Manling Li · Yunzhu Li · Jiayuan Mao · Wenlong Huang,,"An embodied agent is a generalist agent that can take natural language instructions from humans and perform a wide range of tasks in diverse environments. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of foundation models, which have shown remarkable success in supporting embodied agents for different abilities such as goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling (causal transitions from preconditions to post-effects). We categorize the foundation models into Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs). In this tutorial, we will comprehensively review existing paradigms for foundations for embodied agents, and focus on their different formulations based on the fundamental mathematical framework of robot learning, Markov Decision Process (MDP), and design a structured view to investigate the robot’s decision making process. This tutorial will present a systematic overview of recent advances in foundation models for embodied agents. We compare these models and explore their design space to guide future developments, focusing on Lower-Level Environment Encoding and Interaction and Longer-Horizon Decision Making."
