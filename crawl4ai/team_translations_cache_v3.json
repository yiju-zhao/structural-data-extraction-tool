    "challenge_sumary": "Deploying neural combinatorial optimization for AI-driven network control faces foundational hurdles. Models must represent large, dynamic graph structure and strict discrete constraints, guarantee feasibility, and remain robust under nonstationary traffic, failures, and distribution shift. Achieving strong generalization across unseen topologies and demand regimes while providing anytime solutions and bounded suboptimality is essential. Learning needs to integrate with classical operations research via primal–dual methods, Lagrangian penalties, and certifiable post-processing, enabling hybrid solvers and warm starts. Training at scale demands sample-efficient imitation/offline RL, constraint-aware objectives, and procedurally generated curricula. Finally, low-latency, hardware-efficient inference and rigorous, KPI-aligned benchmarks are required for production optical routing and spectrum assignment.",
