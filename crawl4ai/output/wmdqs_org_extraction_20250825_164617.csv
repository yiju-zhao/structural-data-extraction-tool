# 1st Workshop on Multilingual Data Quality Signals,"![Workshop Masthead](https://wmdqs.org/masthead.webp) # 1st Workshop on Multilingual Data Quality Signals [Palais des Congrès Montréal, Canada](https://maps.google.com/?q=Palais+des+Congr%C3%A8s+Montreal+Canada) **10 October 2025** [Call for Papers](https://wmdqs.org/cfp/) [Shared Task](https://wmdqs.org/shared-task/) Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) not only need large quantities of data, but also need data of sufficient quality. Ensuring data quality is even more important in a multilingual setting, where the amount of acceptable training data in many languages is limited. Indeed, for many languages even the fundamental step of language identification remains a challenge, leading to unreliable language labels and thus noisy datasets for underserved languages. In response to these challenges, we will be holding the first Workshop on Multilingual Data Quality Signals (WMDQS) in tandem with COLM. We invite the submission of long and short research papers related to data quality in multilingual data. Even though most previous work on data quality has been targeted at LLM development, we believe that research in this area can also benefit other research communities in areas such as web search, web archiving, corpus linguistics, digital humanities, political sciences and beyond. We therefore encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines. WMDQS will also include a shared task on language identification for web text. We invite participants to submit novel systems which address current problems with language identification for web text. We will provide a training set of annotated documents sourced from Common Crawl to aid development.","* ![Sebastian Nagel](https://wmdqs.org/sebastian-nagel.webp) **Sebastian Nagel** (Common Crawl Foundation): Sebastian is a programmer and computational linguist.

She has a background in machine translation research, holds a PhD from Heidelberg University and previously worked at Google Translate. She particularly enjoys collaborative research for improving the diversity and accessibility of NLP research, e.g. in collaborations with grassroots NLP communities like Masakhane, or with the Cohere Labs community.

His research focuses on multilingual NLP and speech processing, especially for low-resource languages. His PhD focused on NLP for African languages but he is now expanding his scope to other regions of the world, including languages of South Asia, South-East Asia and the Americas."
