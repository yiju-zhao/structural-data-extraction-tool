    "challenge_sumary": "Core challenges span building a distributed AI framework that unifies training/inference, agent execution, and RL. Key gaps include: a consistent state/memory model for multi-turn dialogue (long-context retention) across services, with portable schemas, persistence, and synchronization semantics; first-class asynchronous orchestration primitives (typed tools, futures/actors, event-driven DAGs) with correctness (idempotency, exactly-once), backpressure, and observability; low-level multimodal data fusion with temporal alignment and calibrated uncertainty (Bayesian/conformal) for robust decision-making; scalable infra for KV-cache sharding, retrieval-augmented memory, scheduling, elasticity, and fault-tolerant checkpoints; RL for tool-use with off-policy evaluation and credit assignment in concurrent workflows; and end-to-end safety/privacy: adversarial input robustness, policy enforcement, data minimization, differential/federated privacy, secure execution, and provenance. Standardization and interoperability across components remain open."

    "challenge_sumary": "This BU targets trustworthy Agentic AI and adaptive agent systems. Core challenges include robust, privacy-preserving user intent inference under sparse, ambiguous, or adversarial signals; unified context and long-term memory architectures enabling continual, self-supervised learning and safe self-evolution while mitigating drift, forgetting, and specification gaming; runtime uncertainty quantification with monitors for distribution shift, goal misalignment, and tool/environment failures, enabling risk-aware decisions, rollback, and self-healing; and modular architectures that compose perception, planning, tools, and memory via formal interfaces, provenance, and policy constraints. First-principles issues span formal intent representation, causal/temporal representation learning, verifiable adaptation and constraint satisfaction, scalable online evaluation and guardrailed exploration, and end-to-end guarantees for safety, reliability, and compliance across heterogeneous agents and non-stationary environments."
