TUE 2 DEC,8:30 a.m.,Expo Talk Panel,Telling Stories at Scale: Multimodal ML in the Global Media Landscape,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/128652,,9:30 AM,"Netflix has long been recognized as a pioneer in personalization, leveraging member preference data to recommend the most engaging shows, movies, and games. In recent years, we have expanded our use of machine learning and data-driven approaches to support a wide array of upstream creative and operational workflows. In this talk, we will discuss how modern AI methods – contrastive learning, transformers, cross-modal retrieval, graph neural networks, etc. – are transforming the curation, localization, promotion, and launch of stories on a global scale. A distinctive aspect of our work is the integration of highly creative assets—text, images, video, and speech—alongside traditional tabular datasets. We will highlight unique challenges that arise at the intersection of multimedia, personalization, and web-scale products, and share how advanced ML/AI techniques are addressing these challenges to connect great stories with our worldwide audience.",,存储,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,关键术语：模型训练↔ML/AI(+1)，数据访问模式↔跨模态检索/数据规模(+1)；直接性：未涉及训练IO与内存访问优化，仅概念相关(+2)；相关性：会场偏多模态内容与个性化算法，团队为存储与数据访问优化，技术栈不同(+2)
