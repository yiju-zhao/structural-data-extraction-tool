        "The world's leading sensor manufacturers are building on NVIDIA and Holoscan for real-time AI solutions.",
        "Physical AI starts where data is generated—the edge of the edge; a tight integration of data acquisition systems, sensors, networking, and GPUs is essential for autonomous systems and experiments.",
        "Edge computing can span from embedded computing (small size, weight, and power) to large-scale data center deployments—as long as there's a tight coupling between compute and the instrument.",
        "Edge supercomputing is an emerging domain where high-speed sensors need data center-like GPU resources and networking for real-time processing."
